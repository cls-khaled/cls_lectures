Asynchronous Vs synchronous

--------------------

synchronous  id Defualt Method in JS = Js Work by Single thread  * * * * * *  Implement Code
from Above to Down
***************
- Is the Default Method in Js
- Operations Runs in Sequence
- Each operation Must wait for the Previous one To Complete


Asynchronous = JS Work by Multi thread ========== Implement Code
by Parallel
*****************
- Operations Runs In Parallel
- this Means that An Operation can occur While Another one Is Still Being Processed


create Asynchronous 
******************************
01- Promise
 by Promise  js create new thread [ New time line ]
 by Complete operation Promise call Resolved and Implement function by then
 if fail call Reject and catch error 


02- Async / Await
--- Short Code
--- organize Code
--- modern Method
